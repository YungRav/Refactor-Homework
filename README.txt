Set alt attributes for image elements

In the CSS I moved the search-engine-optimization, online-reputation-management, and social-media-marketing under the content class since all the applications I wanted to make were identical.
I did the same for the image specifications I wanted to make.
I removed the float-left and float-right classes since I could use the classes that were defined immediately before them.
